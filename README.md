# A-Single-Stage-High-Frequency-Resonant-AC-AC-Converter
In many applications, such as large-scale LCD panel backlighting, street lighting, tunnel lighting, etc., an ac/dc light emitting diode (LED) driver should realize the following three functions at least: power factor correction, multichannel constant current outputs, and galvanic isolation. A novel two-stage multichannel constant current ac/dc LED driver with a low cost and simple structure is implemented, which is composed of a high-frequency resonant ac/ac converter and as many passive LCL-T resonant rectifiers as the number of the output channels. The high frequency resonant ac/ac converter is focused on in this project, which converts the ac-line input voltage into high frequency sinusoidal output voltage. First, topology derivation of the single stage high- frequency resonant ac/ac converter is presented, also the operating principle of it. Then, the steady-state performance of it is completely analyzed, including its input power factor, voltage gain, total harmonic distortion of its output voltage, and its soft switching condition. Finally, a prototype is built and the experimental results are given to verify the theoretical analysis.
