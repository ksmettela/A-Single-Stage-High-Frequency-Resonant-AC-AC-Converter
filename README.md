# A-Single-Stage-High-Frequency-Resonant-AC-AC-Converter
This is a project for a novel two-stage multichannel constant current AC/DC LED driver with a low cost and simple structure. The driver is designed to be used in applications such as large-scale LCD panel backlighting, street lighting, tunnel lighting, and other similar applications. It is capable of realizing three important functions: power factor correction, multichannel constant current outputs, and galvanic isolation.

## Features
The multichannel constant current AC/DC LED driver consists of a high-frequency resonant AC/AC converter and multiple passive LCL-T resonant rectifiers, with the number of rectifiers matching the number of output channels. The focus of this project is the high-frequency resonant AC/AC converter, which converts the AC-line input voltage into a high-frequency sinusoidal output voltage.

The following features are implemented in the driver:

- Topology derivation of the single-stage high-frequency resonant AC/AC converter is presented, along with its operating principle.
- Steady-state performance analysis, including input power factor, voltage gain, total harmonic distortion of the output voltage, and soft switching condition, is provided.
- A prototype of the driver is built and experimental results are given to verify the theoretical analysis.

## How to Use
To use the multichannel constant current AC/DC LED driver, follow these steps:

- Connect the AC-line input voltage to the high-frequency resonant AC/AC converter according to the presented topology.
- Connect the passive LCL-T resonant rectifiers to the output channels of the driver, with the number of rectifiers matching the number of output channels.
- Ensure that the driver is operating within the soft switching condition as analyzed in the steady-state performance analysis.
- Monitor the input power factor, voltage gain, and total harmonic distortion of the output voltage to ensure optimal performance.

## Conclusion
This project provides an overview of a novel two-stage multichannel constant current AC/DC LED driver with a low cost and simple structure. It highlights the key features of the driver, including power factor correction, multichannel constant current outputs, and galvanic isolation. The topology derivation, steady-state performance analysis, and experimental verification are also presented. Users are encouraged to follow the instructions for proper usage and contribute to the project as needed.
